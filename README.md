### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Mike Sebele, a game programmer/developer from Toronto, Canada.
I'm kind of a Unity Guru and specialize in C# programming. I also have a little background in art and animation so I love to make shaders and particle effects.
In recent years my professional work has been mainly VR projects. Check out my github page for more info! mikesebele.github.io  
I am currently working at Might Yell on awesome projects. We just released our newest VR game, A Knight in the Attic!
In my spare time time I've been working on a personal projects and having a blast learning Unity's new Entity Component System.
