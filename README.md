### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Mike Sebele, a game programmer/developer from Toronto, Canada.
I'm kind of a Unity Guru and specialize in C# programming. I also have a little background in art and animation so I love to make shaders and particle effects.
In recent years my professional has been mainly VR projects. Check out my github page for more info! mikesebele.github.io  
My contract with the National Film Board has ended and I'm available for contract work.
In the mean time I've been working on a personal project and having a blast learning Unity's new Entity Component System.
